```

Create a project folder called `project1`. You will put all your Project 1 files in this folder. Download this Rmarkdown template (`PH251D2018_LastName_Project1.Rmd`) from this GitHub site: 

Use R Markdown to demonstrate the following skills:

## 1. 

Run the program file (filename1.r) using the ‘source’ command;

## 2. 

Demonstrate reading an ASCII data file (filename2.dat) to create a ‘data frame’;

## 3. 

Demonstrate simple data manipulation (e.g., variable transformation, recoding, etc.); 4. Demonstrate the use of calendar and Julian dates;

## 5. 

Conduct a simple analysis using existing functions (from R, colleagues, etc.);

## 6. 

Conduct a simple analysis demonstrating simple programming (e.g., a ‘for’ loop);

## 7. 

Conduct a simple analysis demonstrating an original function created by student;;

## 8. 

Create a simple graph with title, axes labels and legend, and output to file;

## 9. 

Demonstrate the use of regular expressions;

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
